# Sqlalchemy-Challenge

Overview:
The project appears to focus on analyzing weather data stored in a SQLite database named "hawaii.sqlite." The script utilizes SQLAlchemy, a Python SQL toolkit, to reflect the database's tables into Python classes. The two main tables in the database are "measurement" and "station."

The analysis can be divided into two parts:

Exploratory Precipitation Analysis:

The script first finds the most recent date in the dataset.
It then calculates the date one year from the last data point to retrieve the last 12 months of precipitation data.
The precipitation data is saved as a Pandas DataFrame and plotted using Matplotlib to visualize the precipitation trend over time.
Summary statistics for the precipitation data are calculated using Pandas.
Exploratory Station Analysis:

The total number of stations in the dataset is calculated using a SQL query.
The script identifies the most active stations by counting the number of rows for each station and presents them in descending order.
It then queries the lowest, highest, and average temperature for the most active station ('USC00519281').
Finally, it queries the last 12 months of temperature observation data for the most active station and plots the results as a histogram.
